What is version control?

Version control systems help you keep track of changes you make in your data. (Project, code or documents etc...)
As you edit you data, the version control system takes a snapshot of your files, in order for you to subit changes to the code or text for review and later submission to the main data source.
Benefits of a version control system include:
Creation of workflows
Version history
Colaboration
History of all changes
Automation
